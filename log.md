# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic HTML, basic CSS, and applied visual design modules on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed the HTML module, which was a refresher from previous courses I completed on CodeAcademy. I enjoyed the CSS module as well but toward the end it took me longer to grasp the concepts.

### Day 2: October 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed applied accessibility and responsive web design principles modules on FreeCodeCamp. Started working on a professional portfolio website to apply the concepts.

**Thoughts**: The applied accessibility module was very interesting because it helped to put a lot of the HTML structure concepts into context. I really enjoyed starting my own project, though I did get stuck on some of the design work for the front page.

### Day 3: October 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Very useful info for page design, but it felt like a lot to wrap my head around at once. Will be very helpful to apply in practice.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid module on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 5: October 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started project #1 for the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp. I learned how to use CodePen and set up a tribute webpage for Emma Gatewood. I worked mainly on the HTML coding for the page.

**Thoughts** I was intimidated at first when I was trying to figure out how to run code tests on CodePen, but once I figured it out, it felt really great to get started with setting the page up. I liked seeing all of the results of my coding instantly.

### Day 6: October 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I completed my tribute webpage for project #1, spent most of today working on the CSS coding.

**Thoughts** It was fun to look at the example CSS code and see how each element related to the final look of the page. I enjoyed creating my own "style" for the page.

### Day 7: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started and completed project #2 for the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp. I created a bakery order form on CodePen.

**Thoughts** I loved creating this project, and got to practice coding various types of survey form inputs. I spent a while working on the background image for the webpage, as I could not get it to show up, but eventually figured it out!
